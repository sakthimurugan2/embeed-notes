GPIO -------------->Have 7 memory space and address,that memory space is called Registers


GPIOA------------>0x4002 0000  -  0x4002 03FF
 
                                                      |
                           All registers for GPIOA have been inside
 
Different address space but only one register

Registers:
     ----->MODER
      ------>OTYPER
      ------>PUPDR
      ------>IDR
      ------>ODR
      ------>BSRR
    ------>LCKR
     ------>AFRL
     ------>AFRH

==> GPIOA  base address will be ------> 0x4002 0000
==> When we know that base address of GPIOA and we know that offset 0x00 then we know the place.

A= Base address(20) + offset(2)
then the base address will be A(22)
{base address + offse}

MODER REGISTER:
      A = base address + offset : 0x00
             start address will be A

OTYPER REGISTER:
       base address + offset : 0x04   --------->Increase by 4  [increase by 4].
                                                                                              UL ---> Unsigned Long

*If both address are same the offset will be zero.

[GPIOA-OFFSET =0X0000UL]

GPIOA-Base (AHB1ENR-BASE + GPIO-OFFSET)  
          

* When we use the (Volatile unsigned int *) then we call as address

* When we do the Integer pointer type cast  (RCCBase + AHB1EN_R_OFFSET) will be changed as address.

WE USE OUTSIDE “*   POINTER” IT HELPS TO FIND THE VALUES OF THE ADDRESS 
(*(volatile unsigned int *)(RCC_BASE + AHB1EN_R OFFSET))
